## Overview

This project is a MultiCloud DevOps implementation aimed at automating the software delivery process across multiple cloud platforms. It utilizes various tools and technologies to achieve continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and monitoring.

## Features

- **GitHub to Jenkins**: Jenkins polls GitHub for code commits, triggering the CI/CD pipeline on each commit.
- **Jenkins to Terraform**: Jenkins utilizes Terraform scripts from GitHub to provision AWS resources.
- **Terraform to AWS**: Terraform provisions and manages the infrastructure on AWS.
- **Ansible to EC2 Instances**: Ansible playbooks configure the provisioned EC2 instances, installing necessary software and setting environment variables.
- **Docker**: Dockerfiles from GitHub are used to build application images, stored in a Docker registry.
- **Jenkins to OpenShift**: Jenkins pipeline deploys application containers to OpenShift.
- **OpenShift to Logging**: OpenShift setup includes centralized logging for monitoring container logs.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors AWS resources, integrating with Jenkins for alerts and monitoring data.
